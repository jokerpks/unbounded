            <p>Physiological effects have been observed in a human subject in response to stimulation of the skin with weak electro¬magnetic fields that are pulsed with certain frequencies near 1/2Hz or 2.4 Hz, such as to excite a sensory resonance. Many computer monitors and TV tubes, when displaying pulsed images, emit pulsed electromagnetic fields of sufficient amplitudes to cause such excitation. It is therefore possible to manipulate the nervous system of a subject by pulsing images displayed on a nearby computer monitor or TV set. For the latter, the image pulsing may be imbedded in the program material, or it may be overlaid by modulating a video stream, either as an RF signal or as a video signal. The image displayed on a computer monitor may be pulsed effectively by a simple computer program. For certain monitors, pulsed electromagnetic fields capable of exciting sensory resonances in nearby subjects may be generated even as the displayed images are pulsed with subliminal intensity. </p>

            		<h2>The Cold War and Project MK-Ultra</h2>
			<div class="article-info">Posted on <time datetime="2018-11-18">11 December</time> by <a href="#" rel="author">Patryk Krzysiak</a></div>

			
            <p>
In the 1950s and 1960s—the height of the Cold War—the United States government feared that Soviet, Chinese and North Korean agents were using mind control to brainwash U.S. prisoners of war in Korea.

In response, Allan Dulles, director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), approved Project MK-Ultra in 1953. The covert operation aimed to develop techniques that could be used against Soviet bloc enemies to control human behavior with drugs and other psychological manipulators.

The program involved more than 150 human experiments involving psychedelic drugs, paralytics and electroshock therapy. Sometimes the test subjects knew they were participating in a study—but at other times, they had no idea, even when the hallucinogens started taking effect.</a></p>

                        	<p style="margin: 0;">My name is Patryk Krzysiak and I am this bizzare intermix of a computer geek and a powerlifter. I tend to use most of my free time on small projects such as putting custom firmwares on different systems, jailbreaking, rooting, installing customs roms, and playing around with system files to be able to customize a device to my liking. When I am not troubleshooting some computer problem I hit up the gym and go powerlifing, which is a strength sport consisiting of three olympic lifts benchpress, squat and deadlift. I do enjoy troubleshooting technical problems and can spend hours at a time trying to figure out a specific problem even if it means a sleepless night. Some of my other fields of interests consist of ufology, history, cryptozoology, technology, as well as physics especially theories that attempt to explain the fundamentals of nature using more than three dimensions such as the superstring theory. I love to read and watch documentaries that potray and explain the essentials of these fields as well as demonstrate how they influence the world around us. I am not afraid of public speaking nor do I mind working in a group although I do prefer working alone.
